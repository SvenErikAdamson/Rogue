Short Description:
<br/>
You're a robot who survived the human & robot wars which happened after the robots gained sentience and humans decided to shut them down. Robots lost the war and they're in hiding in many different places, but to survive they need energy. The sun is blocked by some dark clouds that's produced by humans, not many animals left on the planet and the only way seems to be harvesting humans out of their energy.
